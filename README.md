🌱 ML-Powered Smart Irrigation System – GreenPulse
🏆 3rd Place Winner at AgriTech Hackathon | Cash Prize: ₹30,000

🚀 Overview
GreenPulse is a Machine Learning-powered Smart Irrigation System designed for real-time precision farming. Our system integrates IoT sensors, ML algorithms, and a mobile application to help farmers optimize water usage, enhance crop yield, and promote sustainable agriculture.

🔍 Key Features
✅ Machine Learning-Based Irrigation Prediction – Uses a Random Forest model (99% accuracy) to decide whether irrigation is needed.
✅ Real-Time Monitoring via Mobile App – Displays:

Soil moisture levels at multiple locations

Environmental temperature & humidity

NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) values of the soil
✅ Automated Pump Control – Farmers can manually or automatically activate irrigation via the app.
✅ Solar-Powered & 4G-Connected – Ensures continuous operation, even in remote areas.
